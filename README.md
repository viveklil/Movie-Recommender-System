# Movie-Recommender-System

All entertainment websites or online stores have millions/billions of items. It becomes challenging for the customer to select the right one. At this place, recommender systems come into the picture and help the user to find the right item by minimizing the options.

Recommendation Systems in the world of machine learning have become very popular and are a huge advantage to tech giants like Netflix, Amazon and many more to target their content to a specific audience. These recommendation engines are so strong in their predictions that they can dynamically alter the state of what the user sees on their page based on the userâ€™s interaction with the app.

The business objective for us is:

1:) To create a Collaborative Filtering based Movie Recommendation System.

2:) Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated.

3:) Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE).
